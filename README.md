# Vehicle-Search
This project consists of a Python-based application that automates the process of fetching car images based on car models listed in an Excel sheet and displays these images using a web interface. It involves several components, including Python scripts for data processing, a Flask web application for user interaction, and supporting HTML and CSS files for the frontend.

#Project Structure
car.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for processing car models from an Excel file, searching for images online, and inserting these images into the Excel file. app.py: Flask web application to search for car images either from the local repository or online. styles.css: CSS file for styling the web application's frontend. index.html: HTML file serving as the main page of the web application. vehicle_images_repository/: Directory to store downloaded car images.

#Requirements

Python 3.x Flask requests BeautifulSoup4 openpyxl Pillow (for image processing) Jupyter (for running the notebook)

#Setup and Usage

Install dependencies: pip install flask requests beautifulsoup4 openpyxl pillow

Run the Jupyter notebook: Open car.ipynb in Jupyter. Execute the notebook cells to process the car models and download images.

Run the Flask web application: python app.py

Access the web application: Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.



Overall Workflow:

When the user submits a search query, the script processes the input by normalizing it and separating the brand and model names.
It then attempts to find exact or partial matches for the model name in the image map.
If no matches are found, it performs fuzzy matching separately for both brand and model names.
Finally, it combines the closest matches for brand and model to retrieve the image URL.
The result is displayed on the web page for the user to view.
